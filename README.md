# 2D Array Operations in C

## Overview
This C program performs basic operations on 2D arrays (matrices), including:

- Matrix addition
- Matrix subtraction
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix transpose

It takes input for two matrices from the user and performs the above operations wherever valid based on matrix dimensions.

## Features
- Adds two matrices if they have the same dimensions.
- Subtracts one matrix from another if they have the same dimensions.
- Multiplies two matrices if the number of columns of the first equals the number of rows of the second.
- Computes the transpose of the first matrix.
- Handles dimension mismatches gracefully by displayin
